re: constatnly evolving ( biological ) type systems

    ...even though our programs are carefully handcrafted discrete collections of
    symbols, mosaics of interlocking functions, they continually evolve: we
    change them as our perception of the model deepens, enlarges, gen-
    eralizes until the model ultimately attains a metastable place within
    still another model with which we struggle.
